# pt_math

This repository contains resources for experiments with PyTorch-based math models.

## Setting up the `ptmath` CPU environment

Use the provided setup script to create a Python virtual environment with CPU-only PyTorch:

```bash
bash setup_ptmath_cpu.sh
```

This creates a virtual environment named `ptmath` and installs PyTorch, torchvision, and torchaudio compiled for CPU. Activate the environment with:

```bash
source ptmath/bin/activate
```
